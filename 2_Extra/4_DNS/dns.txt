DNS Domain System: Responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses.
Domain Name System Database (Records the mapping between domain names and IP addresses; browsers use DNS to find IP addresses).
Checking browser cache.
Checking operating system cache (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts).
Checking router cache.
Checking ISP DNS cache (Internet Service Provider).
Checking root domain name servers (root name servers).
Once the IP address is obtained, the browser will send a connection request to the server.

Use regular expressions to validate parameters input by users.
If there are any keywords that match SQL syntax, replace them with legitimate characters or equivalents.

Parameterized queries are the most secure way to prevent SQL Injection in the vast majority of cases.
In fact, it can be considered the only truly secure solution.
The principle behind it involves using placeholders in database queries.

It's important to emphasize that even in the worst-case scenario where SQL injection occurs, 
there's a fundamental principle to follow:
Your system should never have connected to the database using the superuser's credentials
when it went live!!
By avoiding the use of superuser credentials, even in the event of a breach,
the damage would be limited. If, on the other hand,
 superuser credentials were used, the consequences could be far more devastating!
