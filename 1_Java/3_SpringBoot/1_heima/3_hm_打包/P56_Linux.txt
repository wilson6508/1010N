nohup: is short for no hangup: This prevents the command from 
being terminated when the terminal session is closed or disconnected

2>&1: This redirects standard error to standard output.
Any error messages generated by the Java application will also be written to the "server.log" file.

&: This symbol tells the shell to run the command in the background
